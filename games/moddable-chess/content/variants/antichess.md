## Antichess

Captures are mandatory. Lose all your pieces to win. Inverts the entire logic of chess.


{{svg:antichess-board.svg "Antichess — starting position"}}

### Setup

**Board:** Standard 8×8.

**Setup:** Standard chess setup.

**FEN:** `rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1`

### Rules

- If a capture is available, you MUST capture. If multiple captures are available, you may choose which one.
- The King has no royal status — it can be captured like any other piece and there is no check or checkmate.
- No castling.
- Pawns may promote to King (in addition to the usual pieces).
- Stalemate (no legal moves) is a WIN for the stalemated player.

### Win Condition

Lose all your pieces, or be stalemated.

### Strategy

You want to force your opponent to capture your pieces while avoiding being forced to keep yours. Opening theory is highly developed — certain openings force wins within a few moves.

## Three-Check

Deliver three checks to win. No checkmate needed. Completely changes the value of forcing moves.


{{svg:three-check-board.svg "Three-Check — starting position"}}

### Setup

**Board:** Standard 8×8.

**Setup:** Standard chess setup.

**FEN:** `rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1`

### Rules

All standard chess rules apply. Each player's check count is tracked throughout the game.

### Win Condition

- Checkmate (as normal), OR
- Deliver check three times. Each check is counted regardless of whether it was blocked, evaded, or interposed.

### Strategy

Pieces that give check frequently (Queen, Bishops on open diagonals) become much more valuable. Sacrificing material to deliver checks becomes a core tactic. Defensive play must prioritise minimising the number of times the King is checked, not just surviving.

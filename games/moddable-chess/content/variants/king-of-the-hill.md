### Setup

**Board:** Standard 8×8.

**Setup:** Standard chess setup.

**FEN:** `rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1`

### Rules

All standard chess rules apply. No modifications to piece movement, captures, or special moves.

### Win Condition

- Checkmate (as normal), OR
- Move your King to any of the four centre squares (d4, e4, d5, e5).

### Strategy

The King becomes an attacking piece. You must balance aggression (advancing the King) with safety (not exposing it to check). Games are shorter and more tactical — passive play is punished because the opponent can simply march their King to the centre.

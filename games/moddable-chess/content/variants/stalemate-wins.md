## Stalemate Wins

Standard chess with one rule change: stalemating your opponent wins the game instead of drawing. This eliminates all stalemate-based drawing resources.


{{svg:stalemate-wins-board.svg "Stalemate Wins — starting position"}}

### Setup

**Board:** Standard 8×8.

**Setup:** Standard chess starting position.

**FEN:** `rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1`
### Rules

All standard chess rules apply, except:
- Stalemate is a win for the player who delivered it (not a draw).
- Check and checkmate work normally.
- All other draw conditions (threefold repetition, 50-move rule, insufficient material) still apply.

### Win Condition

Checkmate OR stalemate your opponent.

### Strategy

This variant makes King and Pawn endgames far more decisive. In standard chess, many K+P vs K positions are drawn because the defending King reaches a stalemate square. Here, those are all wins. The Queen becomes even more dominant — her ability to restrict the enemy King's squares creates stalemate threats. Trading down when ahead in material is even stronger because stalemate is now a winning technique, not something to avoid.

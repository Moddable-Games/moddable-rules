## Racing Kings

No checks allowed. Race your King to rank 8. A pure positional race with no violence.


{{svg:racing-kings-board.svg "Racing Kings — starting position"}}

### Setup

**Board:** Standard 8×8.

**Setup:** All pieces start on ranks 1–2 in a specific non-standard arrangement. No pawns.

**FEN:** `8/8/8/8/8/8/krbnNBRK/qrbnNBRQ w - - 0 1`

### Rules

- No move may give check (to either King). Any move that would place either King in check is illegal.
- No castling. No pawns. No pawn promotion.

### Win Condition

First player to move their King to rank 8 wins. If White reaches rank 8, Black gets one more move — if Black also reaches rank 8, the game is a draw.

### Strategy

Block your opponent's King path while clearing your own. Rooks and Queens control files; Bishops control diagonals. The constraint against giving check makes many "obvious" blocking moves illegal.

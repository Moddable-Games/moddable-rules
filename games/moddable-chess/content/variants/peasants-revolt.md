An asymmetric battle: White has a King and eight pawns against Black's King and two Knights. Can the peasant army overwhelm the mounted warriors?

### Setup

**Board:** Standard 8×8.

**Setup (FEN):** `2n1k1n1/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/4K3`

White: King (e1) + 8 pawns (rank 2).
Black: King (e8) + 2 Knights (c8, g8) + 8 pawns (rank 7).

### Rules

All standard chess rules apply, including:
- Pawns can double-step from starting rank.
- En passant is available.
- Pawns promote normally.
- No castling for White (no Rooks). Black cannot castle either (no Rooks).

### Win Condition

Checkmate, same as standard chess.

### Strategy

White must advance pawns toward promotion while using the King to support. Black's Knights are mobile and can blockade pawns or pick them off. Black's strategy is to use Knights to permanently block White's pawn chains and pick off isolated pawns. White should create multiple passed pawns on different wings — two Knights can't be everywhere at once. If White promotes even one pawn, the material advantage is usually decisive.

## Shatar (Mongolian Chess)

The traditional chess of Mongolia. There is no concept of check — you win by stripping the opponent of all pieces except their King.

### Setup

**Board:** Standard 8×8.

**Setup:** Standard chess setup.

**FEN:** `rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1`

### Rules

- There is no check or checkmate. The King is never in "check" and can move into attacked squares.
- You may capture the opponent's King (it is treated as a normal piece for capture purposes).
- The game ends when one player has only their King remaining (bare king = loss).
- Capturing the King directly also wins.
- All pieces move as in standard chess otherwise.
- Castling, en passant, and promotion work as normal.

### Win Condition

Leave the opponent with a bare King (all other pieces captured), or capture their King directly.

### Strategy

Since there's no check, the King can be used aggressively as a fighting piece. You don't need to protect your King from attack — only from having all supporting pieces captured. Material advantage is paramount since the goal is total piece elimination. Endgame technique focuses on stripping the last defenders rather than constructing checkmate patterns.

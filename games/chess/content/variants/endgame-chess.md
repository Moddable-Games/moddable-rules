## Endgame Chess

Only pawns and Kings. No back-rank pieces at all. Pure endgame technique from move one — pawn structure, King activity, and promotion races.

### Setup

**Board:** Standard 8×8.

**Setup (FEN):** `4k3/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/4K3`

Each side: King (on e-file) + 8 pawns on second/seventh rank. No Rooks, Knights, Bishops, or Queens.

### Rules

All standard chess rules apply, including:
- Pawns can double-step from their starting rank.
- En passant is available.
- Pawns promote normally (to Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight).
- No castling (no Rooks exist).

### Win Condition

Checkmate (typically achieved after promoting a pawn to Queen).

### Strategy

This is pure King and Pawn endgame theory from the first move. Key concepts: opposition (Kings facing each other across odd squares), passed pawns, pawn breakthroughs, and the race to promote. The King must be active — advancing toward the centre to support pawn pushes. Creating a passed pawn (one with no opposing pawns in its path) is usually the path to victory. Tempo and triangulation matter enormously.
